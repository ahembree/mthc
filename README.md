# mthc ![mthc](https://github.com/pe3zx/mthc/workflows/mthc/badge.svg?branch=master&event=workflow_dispatch)

**mthc** orginally came from **M**ISP, **T**heHive and **C**ortex. It is intentionally built to automatically deploy [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/#section_thehive) and [Cortex](https://thehive-project.org/#section_cortex) in one shot. By the way, due to limitiation from each platform, I cannot find a way truly automate the build process without manual configuration. Some processes such as registration and grabbing/providing API keys still required human interaction.

**mthc** comes with built-in reverse proxy that can be used to support either plain HTTP or HTTP with SSL/TLS. [FiloSottile/mkcert](https://pe3zx.blogspot.com/2019/01/deploy-your-own-local-misp-with-https.html) provides a simple way to generate locally trusted certificates for testing.
